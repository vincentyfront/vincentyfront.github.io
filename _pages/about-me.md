Hi I'm Vince it's nice to meet you. I'm a lifelong resident of Los Angeles, specifically the San Fernando Valley. I love working with data and I love working as part of a team. Learing what makes people themselves excites me. My hobbies are playing sports, watching movies, and trying out new restaurants.

Here are some fun facts about me:
* My favorite professional sports teams are the Dodgers, Lakers, and Steelers, and my favorite college sports teams are UCLA and Northwestern
* I am a lifelong Lego enthusiast! My favorite themes are City and Star Wars
* I was in the top 0.005% of Selena Gomez & the Scene listeners on Spotify in 2022
* I like board games and strategic games! Catan, chess, and more! My favorite game is an online computer game called MouseHunt, which I have been playing for 
* My ideal free night dinner at a good restaurant, seeing a movie in theaters, or taking a walk under the night sky
* I was chosen to be the league manager of my buddies' fantasy football league and have served in that role for <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2017)</script> seasons now

Two truths and a lie:
1. I've been playing a game for the last <script>document.write(Math.floor((Math.abs(new Date() - new Date("2010-10-14")) / 31556926000)))</script> years where I'm a hunter assigned to capture mice that emulate humans
2. I ended up seeing the film *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* twice in theaters in the same day
3. I once made a layup, free throw, three pointer, and half court shot in 30 seconds

<div class="ttl_answer">Hover over me for the answer!</div>
<div class="hide">The lie is I ended up seeing the film *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* twice in theaters in the same day! I actually did see the same film in theaters twice in the same day, but it was <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em></div>
