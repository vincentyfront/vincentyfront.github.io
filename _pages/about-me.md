Hi I'm Vince, I appreciate you visiting my website! I'm a lifelong resident of Los Angeles, specifically the San Fernando Valley. I love working with data and as part of a team. Learning what makes each person I meet unique excites me. My hobbies are playing sports, watching movies, and going to Dodger games.

Here are some fun facts about me:
* My favorite sports teams are the Dodgers, Lakers, Steelers, UCLA, and Northwestern
* I am a lifelong Lego enthusiast! My favorite themes are City and Star Wars
* I love strategic games - in fact, I've been playing one for the last <script>document.write(Math.floor((Math.abs(new Date() - new Date("2010-10-14")) / 31556926000)))</script> years where I'm a hunter tasked to capture mice that emulate humans
* I've attended over 10 mindfulness meditation retreats
* I was chosen to be the league manager of my buddies' fantasy football league and have served in that role for <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2017)</script> seasons now

Two truths and a lie:
1. I went skydiving
2. I saw the film *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* in theaters twice in the same day
3. I have been to over 15 different U.S. States

<div class="hide"> 
1. Truth! I skydived with my family in 2025 which included my 87 year-old grandpa! There is truly nothing like it<br />
2. Lie! I did see the same film in theaters twice in the same day, but it was <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</em> <br />
3. Truth! I've been to 18 different states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and West Virginia <br />
